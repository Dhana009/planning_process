## 💡 STUDY TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Daily Routine Best Practices

**Morning Study (2-3 hours):**
- Best for solving coding problems (fresh mind)
- Best for writing conceptual answers
- High focus work

**Evening Study (1-2 hours):**
- Best for reviewing completed questions
- Best for reading and understanding
- Lighter cognitive load

### How to Study Each Type

**Coding Problems:**
1. Read problem (5 min)
2. Try solving yourself WITHOUT looking (15-30 min)
3. If stuck, look at hints/solution (10 min)
4. Code it completely and test (15 min)
5. Explain solution out loud (5 min)
6. Note time/space complexity

**Conceptual Questions:**
1. Read question (2 min)
2. Try answering yourself first (10 min)
3. Research and write complete answer (30 min)
4. Code examples (10 min)
5. Connect to SDET role/test automation (5 min)
6. Practice explaining out loud

**Review Questions (Already Complete):**
1. Read question and understand (3 min)
2. Think about answer before reading (2 min)
3. Read provided answer/explanation (5 min)
4. Practice explaining in your own words (3 min)
5. Note any follow-up questions

---

## 🎯 ADJUSTMENT GUIDELINES

### If You're Moving Faster
- Complete more coding problems per day
- Add extra review sessions
- Start mock interviews earlier
- Dive deeper into advanced topics

### If You Need More Time
- Focus on High Priority items first
- Extend to 50-60 days
- Reduce daily hours (1.5-2 hours)
- Keep Week 7 as polish week

### If You Have Less Time (30 days)
- Skip Selenium section (focus on Playwright)
- Reduce coding problems to top 30
- Focus on High Priority conceptual questions only
- Week 5 onwards: intense review
