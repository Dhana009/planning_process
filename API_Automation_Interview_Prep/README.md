## 💡 STUDY TIPS

### For Maximum Success:

**1. Active Learning**
- Don't just read - try to answer before looking at solutions
- Write actual code for coding problems
- Use real APIs for practice (JSONPlaceholder, ReqRes)
- Explain answers out loud (interview practice)

**2. Focus on "Why"**
- Understand WHY we validate certain aspects
- Be ready to explain trade-offs
- Think about real-world applications

**3. SDET Mindset**
- Always mention framework design and maintainability
- Talk about test strategy, not just test execution
- Emphasize automation and CI/CD integration

**4. Practice Under Pressure**
- Time yourself on coding problems
- Practice explaining without notes
- Do mock interviews with questions from this bank

**5. Build Examples**
- Create a GitHub repo with your API test framework
- Show interviewers real code you've written
- Demonstrate framework design with sample projects
