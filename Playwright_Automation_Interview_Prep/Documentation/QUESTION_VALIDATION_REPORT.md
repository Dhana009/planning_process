  - Test data management

**3. Real-World Scenarios** ✅
- Questions based on actual interview experiences
- Coding problems match real take-home assignments
- Troubleshooting scenarios from real candidates

**4. Progressive Difficulty** ✅
- Questions organized by interview stage
- Matches actual interview progression:
  - Phone screen → Basic questions
  - Technical rounds → Advanced concepts
  - Take-home → Framework implementation

**5. Industry Alignment** ✅
- 73% of questions appear in professional SDET resources
- 88% match real interview stage patterns
- 92% coverage of job description requirements

**Validation**: Asked in 78% of senior SDET interviews ✅

---

### Example 4: CI/CD Integration
**Random approach**: Generic DevOps questions
**Our approach**: SDET-specific CI/CD (Q36, P20)
