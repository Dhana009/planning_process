## ✅ QUESTIONS NOT FOUND IN OUR LIST (From Internet)

### Additional Questions Found Online (Not in Our List):
1. **"What is a virtual environment in Python?"** - Not in our list (could add to optional)
2. **"Explain Python's `asyncio` module"** - Not in our list (advanced async programming)
3. **"How do you debug Python code?"** - Not in our list (practical skill)
4. **"What is pytest and how does it differ from unittest?"** - Not in our list (framework-specific)

**Analysis**: These are valid questions but:
- Virtual environments: More DevOps/setup related
- Asyncio: Very advanced, rarely asked for SDET
- Debugging: Practical skill, not conceptual Python
- Pytest: Framework-specific (not pure Python concepts)

**Recommendation**: Our list focuses on pure Python concepts, which is correct. These additional questions are more tool/framework-specific.
