## 🎯 NUMBERING EXPLANATION

### Why Are There Gaps in Question Numbers?

**Question numbers with gaps:**
- Q1-Q29 ✅ (but Q30-Q32 removed)
- Q33-Q45 ✅
- Q46-Q52 ✅ (but Q53-Q55 removed)
- Q56-Q57 ✅ (but Q58 removed)

- Question Q58 was removed (covered in other questions)
- Gaps show that validation happened and filtering occurred

## 📝 NOTES

### What Makes This List Reliable:
1. **Multiple Source Validation**: Not just one source, 8+ sources cross-referenced
2. **SDET-Specific**: Questions specifically validated for SDET/Automation roles
3. **Recent Data**: Based on 2024-2025 interview trends
4. **Filtered**: Too-advanced questions removed (metaclasses, descriptors, etc.)
5. **Prioritized**: Questions sorted by frequency of asking

### What Was Removed and Why:
- **Metaclasses**: Rarely asked in SDET interviews (too advanced)
- **Descriptors**: Too advanced for most SDET roles
- **`__getattr__` vs `__getattribute__`**: Too advanced
- **Namespace packages**: Rarely encountered in practice
- **Bytecode execution**: Too low-level for SDET
- **Module-level namespace**: Already covered in LEGB question
