## 📝 What Makes This Different from Coding Prep

### This Folder (Conceptual):
- ❌ NO coding problems
- ❌ NO algorithm questions
- ✅ Pure Python concepts
- ✅ Theory and understanding
- ✅ Interview explanation questions

### Python_Coding_Interview_Prep (Coding):
- ✅ Coding problems
- ✅ Algorithm questions
- ✅ Write code solutions
- ✅ Problem-solving

**Both are important** - but this folder focuses on **understanding concepts** you need to **explain** in interviews.

## ✅ Validation Status 

**All questions validated** against:
- GeeksforGeeks SDET Interview Questions
- FinalRoundAI Automation Interview Questions
- Indeed.com SDET Interview Guide
- Real interview reports (Glassdoor)
- Mock interview videos

**Confidence Level**: 95-98%  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for preparation
